- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

# Overview
Stratos is a production-ready 3D printer based on the Voron V0 frame, designed for high-speed, modular printing. With its ability to swap tools and beds, Stratos is capable of future upgrades, making it perfect for personal or small-scale industrial use.

The base machine is a CoreXY printer with 500+mm/s move speed, 30k+ acceleration, and the option for tool changer slots in the future. The printer is partially enclosed, with openings for robot-assisted tool & bed swapping, and can support attachments like multiple nozzle sizes or tool heads (such as PnP heads).

Software-wise, Stratos runs Klipper firmware on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, enabling seamless integration with other automation software like OpenPNP, utilizing macros and Linux ports for a fully automated system.

# Day 1 - March 8
Total hours: 3
Today was mostly learnigd day for 3d printers basics. I learned about how 3D printers work. What are different motion systems. What are the different components that make up these 3D printers.
